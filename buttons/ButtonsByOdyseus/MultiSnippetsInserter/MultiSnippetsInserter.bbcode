[*] [b]Save file expanded:[/b] If enabled, the content of the items file will be saved with a line break at almost every tag (this makes it a little easier to read).

[color=red][b][size=150]Known issues[/size][/b][/color]
All Gecko applications in which I tried this button handles/renders [i]input elements[/i] and selections in totally different ways. Not to mention the HTML elements with [i]contenteditable[/i] attribute enabled (which by themselves are a total aberration of nature). That made the creation of universal [i]text inserter[/i] and [i]get/set selection[/i] functions an absolute nightmare!!! Considering this, I did my absolute best to make this button work under almost all possible circumstances. This does not rule out the possibility of some [i]quirks[/i]. [color=red]If any error/quirk is found, follow the guidelines found on the [b]Error report[/b] section.[/color]
