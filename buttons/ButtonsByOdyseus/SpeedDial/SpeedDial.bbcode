[size=150][b]Description[/b][/size]
This is a simple button that creates a menu with shortcuts (menuitems) to websites. I created this button because I was looking for a way to replace an extension that I used as my homepage ([url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/super-start]Super Start[/url]). I called it Speed ​​Dial due to the fact that I've added to it keyboard shortcuts to access the sites.

[list]
[*] Ability to automatically create an item based on the current loaded page. Open options menu and click [b]Add current tab[/b].
[*] Items can be added/edited/removed without the need to edit the button itself. Just Right click on any existent item inside the menu and a context menu will appear.
[*] Items can be added/edited/removed by directly editing the "items file". This file is stored inside the profile folder and can be opened from the options menu ([b]Edit items file[/b] menu item).
[*] Ability to set up countless shortcut keys (0-9, a-z, A-Z or any other character that can be entered with a keyboard). Shortcut keys can be accessed/triggered only when the menu is open.
[*] Possibility to open/close the menu with a hotkey. Configurable when editing the button ([b]Button settings[/b] tab).
[*] Possibility to open the menu in the center of the screen (not anchored to Speed Dial's button).
[*] The appearance of the menu and menuitems can be customized with CSS through the Help tab of this button. The style sheet can be completely disabled from the options window.
[*] Although not recommended nor practical, an unlimited number of items/sites can be added.
