[*] The menu appearance can be converted into a panel.
[*] [b]Advanced-Basic differences:[/b][list]
[*] [b]Advanced:[/b] This version supports images for each User Agent and every time the User Agent is changed, the button image will change to that of the current User Agent (can be disabled). The default image for this button can be changed by editing the variable called [b]defaultImage[/b], inside the Initialization tab. If the current User Agent doesn't have an image assigned or is the default User Agent, the button will use the image stored in the [b]defaultImage[/b] variable. All items are saved inside the Initialization tab of the button.
[*] [b]Basic:[/b] This version doesn't support images and all items are saved inside a preference. The image for this button can be changed like any other Custom Button.[/list][/list]
