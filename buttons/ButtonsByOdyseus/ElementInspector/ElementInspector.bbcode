This button is based on the Firefox add-on of the same name ([url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/element-inspector/]Element Inspector[/url]). Its sole purpose is to add a shortcut to inspect the application elements with [url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/dom-inspector-6622]DOM Inspector add-on[/url]. Needless to say that the DOM Inspector add-on needs to be installed and activated for this button to work.
