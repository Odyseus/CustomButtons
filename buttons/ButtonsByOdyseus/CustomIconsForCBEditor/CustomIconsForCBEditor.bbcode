This button adds new images to the Custom Buttons Editor and is based on a button of the same name that can be found in the [url=https://forum.mozilla-russia.org/viewtopic.php?id=55963]Mozilla Russian forum[/url]. The author is [b]SendAbuse[/b] and is based on an idea by [b]okkamas_knife[/b] with code contribution from [b]InfoCatcher[/b].

The main difference between my version of this button compared to the original, is that I have added the option to add images from a folder. I also added a menu to change certain options.

[b][size=150]Usage[/size][/b]
The images are stored inside the Help tab of this button (one image per line). Left-clicking on this button will switch between its enabled/disabled state. More than one version of this button can be installed at the same time containing different sets of icons. It will also work for buttons edited in tabs (See [url=https://github.com/Infocatcher/Custom_Buttons/tree/master/Edit_Custom_Button_in_Tab]Edit Custom Button in Tab[/url] button by [b]InfoCatcher[/b] or [url=http://custombuttons.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=3599]Custom Buttons Context Menu Extended[/url]).
