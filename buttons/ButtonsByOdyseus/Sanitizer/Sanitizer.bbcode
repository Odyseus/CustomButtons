[size=150][b]Description[/b][/size]
Sanitizer is based/build around the script called sanitize.js (chrome://browser/content/sanitize.js) that can be found in all Firefox-based browsers (in SeaMonkey Sanitizer.jsm). Hence the name of this button. Each menu item has the exact same name (except the ones that are abbreviated) and runs the exact same action as its equivalent in the browser's native clean dialog.

Sanitizer can be configured with a wide range of options to suit almost any need and/or taste. So it is advisable to read the specifications found below before installing and using this button. But rest assured that the safest/less annoying options are ENABLED by default. And the most dangerous/more obtrusive ones are DISABLED by default.
