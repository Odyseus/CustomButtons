This script combines the features of several scripts/extensions (See contributors section). Its main purpose is to make use of any translation service in a fast and comfortable way without having to leave the page you are reading by showing a panel with the translation result. The panel is used to show the translation result of the currently selected text and/or the clipboard content. It can also translate the entire page with a single click on the icon inside the URL bar.

[color=#FF0000][size=120][b]Absolutely very important notes!!![/b][/size]
The [b]Bing[/b] and [b]Yandex[/b] translators used in the panel translator make use of the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface]APIs[/url] provided by those two services. These APIs have limits in the amount of characters that can be translated per request, per day and per month. In addition to that, [i]API keys[/i] (a kind of password) are needed to perform the translations.
I provide with this button several [i]API keys[/i] for each service which are used randomly with each translation request. The more people using this button, the faster the limits for those [i]API keys[/i] will be reached. And once those limits are reached, [b]you will not be able to translate text any more[/b].
[i]API keys[/i] can be obtained for free from the respective translation service providers. Near the end of the Initialization tab of this button can be found detailed instructions on how/where to obtain [i]API keys[/i] and what to do once you get them.

[b]Bing translator API limitations:[/b] You can translate UP TO 2.000.000 (2 millions) characters per month using a free subscription.
[b]Yandex translator API limitations:[/b] You can translate UP TO 1.000.000 (1 million) characters per day BUT NOT MORE than 10.000.000 (10 millions) per month.
[b]Google translator has no limitations[/b]
