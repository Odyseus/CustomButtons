This button is based on a [url=https://github.com/ardiman/userChrome.js/tree/master/aboutconfigmultipleselection]script by ardiman[/url] for [url=http://userchromejs.mozdev.org/]UserChromeJS add-on[/url]. It adds the ability to select multiple rows while on about:config page (by pressing the [b]Ctrl[/b] or [b]Shift[/b] keys while clicking), allowing to copy various preferences at the same time. It also adds a new menu item to the about:config context menu called [b]Copy for user.js[/b], which will copy the preference/s ready to be used with the [url=http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file]user.js[/url] file or even the [url=http://kb.mozillazine.org/Prefs.js_file]prefs.js[/url] file.
