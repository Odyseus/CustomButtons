[size=150][b]Options[/b][/size]
[list]
[*] [b]Context menu for images:[/b] If enabled/checked, it will add a context menu for images that, when clicked, will copy to the clipboard the selected image in base64 format.
[*] [b]Force to save images:[/b] If enabled/checked, all page capture actions will save the image to disk instead of loading them in a new tab. Even with this option set to false, images can be saved to disk if the Shift key is pressed while any capture action is performed. As a fails safe, images bigger than 5MB are forced to be saved to disk. Because Base64 images that big will be hard to be loaded into a tab (more than 5 million characters (approx.) inside the URL bar).
[*] [b]Choose hotkey action:[/b] It allows you to choose the action to be performed when this button hotkey is activated.[/list]
