### Readme

- Each of these folders contain the actual buttons in XML format.
- XML files named **OLD###** are old buttons versions.
- The .bbcode files contain the button's post content on the [Custom Buttons](http://custombuttons.sourceforge.net/forum/index.php) forum.
- Images with the same name as the XML file are the icons used on the [buttons index](https://odyseus.github.io/CustomButtons/index.html). Any other images found in these folders are a visual representation of the installed button in action.
