This button adds a button inside the Custom Buttons Editor with a customizable menu which contains code snippets that can be inserted into your buttons. It is based on a button called Custom Paste for Custom Buttons that can be found in the [url=https://forum.mozilla-russia.org/viewtopic.php?id=55963]Mozilla Russian forum[/url]. The author is [b]SendAbuse[/b] with code contribution from [b]okkamas_knife[/b] and [b]InfoCatcher[/b].

I greatly modified the original version of this button and I added more capabilities to it. Ability to create sub-menus, ability to open/close the generated menus on mouseover/mouseout, etc.

[b][size=150]Usage[/size][/b]
The menus/menu items created for the button that will be inserted in CB Editor are generated with information stored inside the Help tab of this button. More than one version of this button can be installed at the same time containing different code snippets. To differentiate each version installed, it is possible to change the color of the each button individually. It's also possible to display its label and change it. It will also work for buttons edited in tabs (See [url=https://github.com/Infocatcher/Custom_Buttons/tree/master/Edit_Custom_Button_in_Tab]Edit Custom Button in Tab[/url] button by [b]InfoCatcher[/b] or [url=http://custombuttons.sourceforge.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=3599]Custom Buttons Context Menu Extended[/url]).
