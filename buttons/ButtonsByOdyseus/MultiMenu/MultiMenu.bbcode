This button has the ability to create very complex menus with menu items that can execute from custom commands to commands from other extensions or from the application itself. You can also create menu items to open paths to any folder, open any file or execute any program with or without arguments. There are also "special items" that can create a list of all installed "add-ons" by type (Extensions, plugins, Stylish styles, Scriptish scripts and GeaseMonkey scripts), preference manipulation, open URLs and execute other Custom Buttons. I created this button as an alternative to the [url=https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/personal-menu/]Personal Menu[/url] extension.

[b][size=150]Features[/size][/b]
[list][*] [b]Multi Menu[/b] can be installed only once (I call it the "master" button). But an [i]infinite[/i] number of [i]slave buttons[/i] can be created with the same functionality of the main button to create countless menu buttons. Each with its own settings.
[*] Custom menus can have [i]infinite[/i] sub-menus.
[*] Up to 5 main menus (side by side).
[*] A total of 14 different types of items can be created with [b]Multi Menu[/b]:[list]
[*] [b]Custom menu item:[/b] A custom menu item that can [i]execute any code[/i] from the application itself or from any installed extension.
[*] [b]Custom menu:[/b] A custom menu that can contain any type of item.
[*] [b]Cloned menu/Cloned menu item:[/b] Any existent menu/menu item from the application or from any installed extension can be cloned to be added to [b]Multi Menu[/b].
[*] [b]Path menu item (full path):[/b] A full path to any folder, file or executable can be added to [b]Multi Menu[/b] to be opened, launched or executed (with and without arguments).
[*] [b]Path menu item (relative path):[/b] Same as full path, but a common "relative path" can be used as a start point. Useful for portable applications.
[*] [b]Menugroup element:[/b] Menu items inside a menu group are displayed with an appearance similar to a button.
[*] [b]Menuseparator element:[/b] Used to create a separator between menu items.
[*] [b]Spacer element:[/b] An element that takes up space but does not display anything. It is usually used to place spacing within a container.
[*] [b]Dialogheader element:[/b] A heading row. This element is designed to be placed inside a dialog element, but in [b]Multi Menu[/b] is used with some tweaks that shrink the element to a proper size for menupopups. The header may have a title and a description.
[*] [b]Custom Buttons item:[/b] This type of item can control other installed Custom Buttons. With support for Custom Button with menus.
[*] [b]List of add-ons or add-on ID:[/b] Ability to create a complete list of all installed add-ons by type (extensions, plugins, themes, Stylish styles and GreaseMonkey/Scriptish scripts). Also can create a single item by just specifying its id.
