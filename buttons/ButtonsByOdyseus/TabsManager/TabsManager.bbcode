The purpose of this buttons is very simple. Manage all opened tabs in a simple way without ever having to open the [b]List all tabs[/b] menu. And while doing so, [b]display all tabs at all times[/b] without having to use the scroll wheel (like in the [i]List all tabs[/i] menu). This is accomplished by displaying all opened tabs in a grid inside a panel (see [b]Images[/b]).

[color=red][size=150][b]Changelog - Updated June 11, 2016[/b][/size]
[list]
[*] Removed everything related to tabs groups. [b]Reasons:[/b] Mozilla removed tabs groups from Firefox and every single add-on that add this feature to Firefox uses totally different methods to implement it.
[*] Now there is no need to edit the button to change its settings.
[*] Added a settings window to manage [b]Tabs Manager[/b] options. The previous method that I used to manage options was kind of annoying.
[*] Added [b]Mute/Unmute selected tabs[/b] to the tabs context menu [i]bulk actions[/i].
[*] General enhancements of the kind [i]do more with less code[/i].[/list][/color]

[b][size=150]Features[/size][/b]
[list][*] A hotkey can be configured to open/close the main panel ([i]Edit button... > Button settings tab[/i]).
[*] Each [i]tab[/i] in the grid has the tabs context menu available and [i][u]it should[/u][/i] be compatible with any menu item added by any extension.
[*] The amount of tabs per row in the grid can be customized from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 30 tabs per row.
[*] Tabs can be [i]multi-selected[/i] (with Ctrl/Cmd + Left click) to perform [i]in bulk actions[/i]. Currently only four [i]in bulk actions[/i] are available from the context menu ([b]Mute/Unmute selected tabs[/b], [b]Pin/Unpin selected tabs[/b], [b]Reload selected tabs[/b] and [b]Close selected tabs[/b]). Selected tabs can also be dragged to other groups of tabs.
[*] Tabs can be dragged to be re-arranged.
[*] Tabs can be directly closed by middle clicking.
[*] Tab content can be previewed.
[*] Tab preview can be zoomed/in-out.
[*] Clicks can be sent to the page content [i]through the preview[/i]. [b][color=red](1)[/color][/b]
[*] The page content can be scrolled [i]through the preview[/i]. [b][color=red](2)[/color][/b]
[*] Some options can be changed from inside the main panel itself ([i]Show in-line options[/i] button, bottom-right corner of the main panel) and their effects will be shown [i]on the fly[/i] without having to close the main panel.[/list]

[b][size=150][color=red]Important notes[/color][/size][/b]
[list]
[*] [b][color=red](1)[/color][/b] Do not expect miracles to happen! LOL You can only send clicks to activate certain elements on the page content [i]through the preview[/i]. You can't select text. You can't open context menus. You can't type inside textboxes.
[*] [b][color=red](2)[/color][/b] Scroll [i]through the preview[/i] will not work on XUL content (about:config, preferences in content, etc.).
[*] After editing this button (to change its image or customize the style sheet inside the Help tab) and/or enabling/disabling the tab preview feature, [b]the browser needs to be restarted[/b]. If you plan never to use tab preview, a restart will never be needed.
[*] This button is designed to be anchored to the Navigation toolbar when opened and have a width equal to the browser's window width. But it can be configured to be anchored wherever you want and have whatever width you want. It can also be configured to [i]play nice[/i] with the Tabs toolbar located at the bottom of the browser's window or even in either of its sides. If in doubt, just ask.
[*] This button [b]will interfere[/b] with the [i]List all tabs[/i] menu button making it unusable. [b]So choose one or the other.[/b]
[*] This button [b]will NOT interfere[/b] with the Tab Scope add-on (Read [b]Contributors[/b] section). Neither that add-on will interfere with this button.[/list]

[b][size=150]Contributors[/size][/b]
All the tab preview features from this button are based on code found on [url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-scope/]Tab Scope add-on[/url] by [b]Gomita[/b]. Thanks to that add-on, the previews are actually useful.
Special thanks to [b]InfoCatcher[/b] who, by reading the code of one of his buttons, [i]taught me[/i] how to use a [i]frame script[/i] (for use in multi-process Firefox) without going bald in the process. LOL
