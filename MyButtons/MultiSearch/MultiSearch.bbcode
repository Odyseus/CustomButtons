[size=150][b]Description[/b][/size]

My initial intention with this button was to add some new features and functions to the default search bar. But that turned out to be way too complicated to perform with my level of knowledge. So I decided to start from scratch and create a button that replaces the search bar, and also add certain features from a couple of add-ons that I used ([url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/Site-Searcher]Site Searcher[/url] and [url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-by-image-by-google]Search By Image (by Google)[/url]). Although this button does not have all the same options of the add-ons mentioned above, I added the functionality that I considered most useful and a few more personal touches that the three above mentioned lack (like Drag&Drop functionality, use of keywords and search local image files, among other things).
