/**
 *  #### Notes to myself ####
 *  1- All Ajax requests throw errors when running from local fyle system. Ignore them.
 *     Examples: "mismatched tag. Expected: </meta>." or "not well-formed".
 *  2- Button URIs are added manually.
 *  3- Name of HTML install pages and Master folders MUST BE EXACTLY THE SAME.
 *  4- URLs to GitHub sources inserted on page load. EMPHASIS on point 3.
 *  5- Code preview is automatically generated from the button URI.
 *  6- #headmenu and #footer are inserted via jQuery from 00-CommonHTML.html file.
 *  7- ALWAYS define variable "syntax" at the end of each install page even if button dosn't have a Help tab.
 *  8- Remember to set the "active" tab for "Button code preview" section.
